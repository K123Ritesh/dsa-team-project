# Expression Converter
This Dart library provides functions to convert between postfix and prefix expressions.

# Import:
import 'expression_converter.dart';

Create an Instance:

ExpressionConverter converter = ExpressionConverter();

Conversion Methods:
String postfixResult = converter.postfixToPrefix("ab+c-def^^*g/");
print("Postfix to Prefix: $postfixResult");

String prefixResult = converter.prefixToPostfix("/*-+abc^d^efg");
print("Prefix to Postfix: $prefixResult");
Use the code carefully.

# Example:

Refer to the main.dartfile for a complete example usage.

# Why Use Stack?
A stack data structure is used for the conversion because:

In postfix expressions, operators follow operands.
In prefix expressions, operators precede operands.
A stack efficiently manages the order of operands and operators during conversion.

# Logic of Expression Converter
# Postfix to Prefix Conversion
Initialize an empty stack.
Iterate through each character in the postfix expression:
If an operand, push it onto the stack.
If an operator, pop two operands, concatenate them with the operator, and push the result back onto the stack.
The final result on the stack is the equivalent prefix expression.
# Prefix to Postfix Conversion
Initialize an empty stack.
Iterate through each character in the prefix expression (from right to left):
If an operand, push it onto the stack.
If an operator, pop two operands, concatenate them with the operator, and push the result back onto the stack.
The final result on the stack is the equivalent postfix expression.
Time Complexity
Both conversion methods have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input expression.
